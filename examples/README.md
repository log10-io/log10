# Examples

## Agents

### CAMEL Agents
- A [CAMEL agent](https://www.camel-ai.org/) is a special type of agent where you let the LLM take on each of the user and assistant roles in succession to [solve a task](https://www.loom.com/share/08c363e88f0f47ff9f42fcbc39e9afb0). Often this results in better solutions to the task without the pain of manual prompt engineering. You can select between Claude (Anthropic) and OpenAI models (at the top of the file). The following examples are provided:
  - `cybersecurity_expert.py` Patching or optimizing code by a security auditor and a software developer
    - `code_optimizer.py` An extension of the security expert where we evaluate if the generated code compiles
  - `email_generator.py` Drafting a sales email by a sales email copyeditor and a sales email copywriter
  - `biochemist.py` Performing a molecular dynamics solution by a PhD student and an Experienced Computational Chemist
  - `translator.py` Writing a blog in a different language by a subject matter expert and a language expert
  - `coder.py` Writing a software program for a domain collaboratively between a domain expert and a programming language expert

### Other Agents
- `scrape_summarizer.py` Scrape and summarize any website

## Evals

Can be run on `OpenAI` or `Anthropic`

- `match.py` A simple example showcasing how to use metrics such as Match, Includes
- `fuzzy.py` Fuzzy matching
- `compiles.py` Test if code generated by the LLM compiles

## Logging (and debugging)

### OpenAI

- `chatCompletion_async_vs_sync.py` Compare latencies when logging in async vs sync mode
- `chatCompletion.py` Chat endpoint example
- `completion_simple.py` Completion endpoint on a simple model, `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` with DEBUG_ enabled and ASYNC_ disabled
- `completion.py` Completion endpoint with `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct`
- `get_url.py` Get the URL of the completion to get the detailed logs on [log10.io](https://log10.io)

### Langchain

- `langchain_babyagi.py` [Langchain's implementation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/use_cases/agents/baby_agi_with_agent.html) of [BabyAGI](https://babyagi.org/)
- `langchain_multiple_tools.py` Langchain with multiple tools
- `langchain_qa.py` Langchain + DocumentQA (also checkout Streamlit example [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/arjunbansal/log10_langchain_qa_streamlit/blob/main/app.py))
- `langchain_simple_sequential.py` Simplest Langchain example with 2 chains in sequence
- `langchain_sqlagent.py` Langchain's SQLAgent for NLP2SQL
- `multiple_sessions.py` Examples illustrating session scoping for Langchain + Log10
- `langchain_model_logger.py` Example of OpenAI (chat and text completions) and Anthropic calls with a log10 logger.

### Anthropic

- `anthropic_completion.py` Simple Anthropic completion example
